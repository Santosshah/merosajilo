                  2. Computers help you work faster
               </h2>
               <p class="para">
               As computers, software, and hardware improve, so do their capabilities. For example, someone with a very basic understanding of a word processor can work faster and enjoy writing more than someone typing on a typewriter. With a word processor, you can easily edit anywhere in a document, erase text, move text, copy text, change fonts, etc. All these things were impossible or tough to do with a typewriter.

After learning the basics of a task or program, you can continue to learn and evolve until you become an expert and even faster at working. For example, someone familiar with a program and knows its keyboard shortcuts can be two to three times faster than someone with a basic understanding of a program.
